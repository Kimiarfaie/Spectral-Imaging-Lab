# Spectral-Imaging-Lab
The assignment for the Spectral Imaging Lab in UGR.

The objective of this project is to process the raw hypersectral data, acquired with the Pika L device (Hyperspectral Imaging Camera), and applying flat-field correction to the data. Subse-
quently, the following tasks will be undertaken: 

Task 1: Spectral Segmentation
Implement spectral segmentation to identify regions containing red, green, and blue pigments within the processed data cube.
• Utilize two distinct spectral metrics for segmentation.
• Analyze and discuss the outcomes of the segmentation process.

Task 2: Illuminant Simulation
• Simulate the appearance of the image under two different CIE illuminants: D65 and D50.
